I've worked with Monica a few times over the last few years in filling consultative sales positions and I've been extremely pleased with the results every time. There are many traits Monica has that you can rely on. First, she won't waste your time. None of her candidates ever left my office with me scratching my head lamenting the lost hour I just spent on an interview. Monica hones right in on qualifications, talents and corporate cultural fit to put the best folks in front of you, without exception! Secondly, you will never question her professionalism. If Monica says she is going to do something, you can rely on it. She is an excellent communicator and has superb follow up skills. She never over promises and always exceeds expectations. Lastly, and what really matters, Monica gets results. Many of my colleagues have also partnered with Monica over the years and we all keep coming back. There is no better recommendation I can give that trumps the fact that I am a repeat customer. Whether you have hiring needs or are looking for the right career opportunity, look no further than Monica Parodi.",

    quote: "Monica has single-handedly shaped our National Sales Force. I had absolutely no doubt that she would rise to the challenge because she has been impressing me for the last 8 years placing amazing candidates in the Fortune 500 Corporate World. Perhaps what impresses me the most is her ability to utilize creativity in enticing \"thoroughbreds\" and \"athletes\" to simply listen to her pitch when they would be otherwise content in their current environment. Well, when the \"pitch\" is on, her personal credibility and integrity have a chance to shine. Her passion for her client's company is obvious to all candidates, which prepares them immensely for their very first meeting with me. Monica is a highly selective and discerning individual that makes my job easier as my face-to-face interviews are always with A+ candidates. Monica is probably going to shoot me for this one, but she knows no time zone restrictions!!!! She sacrifices her personal time on a very regular basis with clients and candidates alike in an attempt to meet many demanding schedules across the country. It is a pleasure to recommend Monica as a results-driven All-Star.",

    quote: "Monica is an experienced professional who gets results. She is very talented at sourcing into firms, versus the more common vetting of just posted information on candidates via the boards. However, the key attribute that she possesses beyond these is her ability to articulate what you wish to be known to the candidate; Being convincing and creative while attracting the best isn't an easy task and she's highly competent in explaining what your company's attributes are, matching them with the right person and moving a prospective person along the process effectively. An intelligent and resourceful partner who is exemplary at follow-up, she gets the job done right in a very timely manner. The final point I'll make is the retention of the employee and overall performance of those individuals--> notably better than most.",

What a pleasure and honor to watch her in action, soaking up every minute like a sponge! She was able to turn around sensitive situations that no one else could seem to master with her excellent influencing and relationship management prowess. Monica is the first to step-up when you need an extra person on your side or just to lend a sympathetic ear. We partnered together on many challenging executive roles where she inspired me to dig deep and to stick with it, even when the outcome was hard to see.
